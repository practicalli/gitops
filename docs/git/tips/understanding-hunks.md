title: Understanding Hunks in Git
---

A hunk in Git terms is a line or several consecutive lines of a file that have changed since the last commit.

Git identifies hunks in the files you change and when you use interactive staging you can be more selective about the hunks you add to the next commit.

    git add -p 


[Examples of hunks]


## Splitting Hunks

[TODO] how does git decide where to split Hunks ?
