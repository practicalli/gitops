# Practicalli GitOps

Practicalli Clojure GitOps provides a hands on approach to learn and practice effective CI & CD workflows.

Guides for local and remote Git workflows for effective project build, test and deployment.  Specific information is provided for Clojure projects, although most of the content is applicable to any programming language.

??? INFO "Related Books"
    [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Clojure Web Services](https://practical.li/clojure-web-services) provides a practical guide to creating APIs and Web Services with Clojure.

!!! INFO "Initial focus around GitHub.com"
    The majority of open source projects are managed via GitHub.com and its workflows, so this is the initial focus of the Practicalli GitOps book.  Other services, e.g. GitLab will also be covered.
